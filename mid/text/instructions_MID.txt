In the next task, you will be able to win money if you are quick enough. Your task is to press your index button when you see the white square. On trials where the white square is preceded by a GREEN circle, you will win $5 if you press the key while the white square is on the screen. On trials where the white square is preceded by a BLUE circle, you are not able to win anything, but we still need you to press your index while the white square is on the screen. The white square will remain on screen for less than 250 milliseconds, so you will need to respond quickly.
If you have questions or are unsure about what your task is, please ask the experimenter now.
