My memory is from Summer 2016. I went to xxxxyyyyzzz with my family, including my brother and parents. We were celebrating xxxxxyyyzzzzzz. It was a wonderful trip, we did things like boating, trying great food, cooking classes, and museums. I remember feeling xxxxx, yyyyyy, zzzzzzzzzz, and wwwwwww. When I look back on this memory, it makes me appreciate such a great time with my family and I hope I get to to it again soon.
