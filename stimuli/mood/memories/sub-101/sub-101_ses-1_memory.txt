I was offered a paid internship that I had spent a lot of effort applying and interviewing for. It was a relief to have been given a wage and also know that I would be able to finish my program. I think I called my mom and sister to let them know. It was special because it was my first paid position in my field and they let me know that they were not going to hire this semester but were so impressed that they made an exception.
