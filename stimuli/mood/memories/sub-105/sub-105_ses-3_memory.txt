I visited Ireland with my brother and sister when I was 18yo. It was awesome to visit family in various parts of the country and explore some of the cities and countryside on our own. I specifically remember a hike we did up to a tower on a particularly windy day and we laughed our heads off by how much it felt like we were going to be blown over.
