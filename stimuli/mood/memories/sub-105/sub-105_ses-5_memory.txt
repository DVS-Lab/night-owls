A positive memory I have is celebrating my anniversary last year. My partner and I went to NYC to see the broadway show Wicked, explored the city, caught up with old friends, and had a marvelous meal out. It was so special to be able to celebrate our relationship and heartwarming to reflect on all our time together.
