A positive memory is celebrating my grandparents' 50th anniversary a few years ago. They hosted a big party and it was full of good food, dancing, and chatting with cousins and family I hadn't seen in years. It was so special to honor their long lasting union among family and friends and reminded me of the importance of family gatherings and celebrations.
