A positive memory is graduating from college, it was a rainy day, but we had lots of fun festivities after the ceremony in the college's great hall, which is a beautiful stone building. I wore a graduation robe that had been passed down from other college graduates in the past which felt extra special. It was such a proud time of commemorating my accomplishments while being surrounded by family and friends.
