A positive memory was when I went to a concert this past Fall with two of my college friends. Before the show, we all grabbed dinner and then headed to the concert together. We saw a band I really love perform and they put on a fantastic show full of fun lights, stage props, and song covers. It was such a fun experience to dance and sing along with these two friends.
