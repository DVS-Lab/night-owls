A positive memory I have is visiting grand canyon national park with my partner a few years ago. We flew to Phoenix and stayed with my partner's grandparents for a couple days and then drove through Sedona to Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon. It was so lovely taking in the red rocks of Sedona and the beautiful vistas in Flagstaff.  One highlight is taking turns telling riddles during our car rides through the valleys as well as cooking salmon and biscuits in our Airbnb.
