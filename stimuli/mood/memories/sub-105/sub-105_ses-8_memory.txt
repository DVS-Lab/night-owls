A positive memory I have is celebrating my coworker's last day on the team at a restaurant last summer. We shared and reminisced the highs and lows of the prior two years together and reflected on our gratitude for having our first job post-university with such a good group of people. It was a momentous celebration full of lots of laughter and excitement for our coworker who was moving onto a new job!
