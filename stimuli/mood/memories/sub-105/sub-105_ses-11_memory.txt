A positive memory for me is visiting my boyfriend while in college and going to the city museum in St. Louis! We had a wonderful time exploring the museum, watching the entertainment, and climbing all about! It was especially fun to embrace the maze-like feel of the museum as well as looking at all the mosaics!
