A positive memory I have is going to the Nutcracker with my grandmother, siblings, and cousins on Christmas eve. The theatre, opera, and ballet are incredibly important to my grandmother so it was so special to get to experience the ballet together. Before the ballet, we went to a brunch buffet and marveled at the festivity of the restaurant lobby and our excitement for the holiday the following day.
