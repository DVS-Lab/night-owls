I traveled to visit my longtime friend in Denver, Colorado last year. I hadn't seen her in a few months and it was great to be together doing our favorite activities including going to a farmers market, going out to coffee shops, hiking up a beautiful trail, and eating out at a terrific Italian restaurant. At the restaurant, I remembered we tried a few different pastas and a chicken entree.
