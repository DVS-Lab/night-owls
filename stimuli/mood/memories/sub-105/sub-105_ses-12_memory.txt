A positive memory was visiting my siblings up in Boston to cheer them on in the Boston marathon! It was so lovely to get to soak up all of the festivities and livelihood of the weekend in Boston and get to witness them running the Boston marathon for the first time. I was so proud of all they had accomplished and it was exciting to cheer among their friends and get to celebrate afterwards!
