When I was sitting at our honours capstone senior dinner and waiting for awards to be announced. I was surrounded by a bunch of friends, my family, and my capstone advisor while they were reading a little bit about the awardee for most Outstanding Capstone. I knew I had been nominated, but when they were reading it, I didn't think it fit my project until the final moment, when I looked to my advisor in shock as they said my name.
