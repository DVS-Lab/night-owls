My entire summer in my dream internship in DC. My supervisor got funding to take me on a TDY to Colorado Springs and we spent the first night bar hopping with VS's, then next two days in the office with a view of the mountains and some dogs. We went to the garden of the gods the second morning and spontaneously hiked over 2700 steps up a mountain and then back down.
