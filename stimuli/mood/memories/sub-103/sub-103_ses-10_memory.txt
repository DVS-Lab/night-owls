The first time I sat in a fire. It's oddly meditating. You can feel the heat and watch the flames dance, your turnouts and airpack are restricting and heavy, your breathing is loud and if anyone talks, you have to hold your breath to hear them. The radio crackles and your airpack beeps and your holding a halogen or a hose, and there is so much going on it's impossible to think of anything else.
