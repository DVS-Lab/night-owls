When I moved into my Airbnb for the summer. Once I cleaned it and got settled in, it was absolutely beautiful. I had a large bathroom and bedroom, and almost the entire wall was windows. The national arboretum was out back, so all I could see when I looked outside was green and trees. It was on the second floor and I went up a spiral staircase to get there, and I would walk every weekend to the laundromat and the grocery store. The bus wasn't far either, so I could easily catch it to work, or to go to museums or farmers markets. And when it rained, the dark clouds mixed with the sunlight peaking through and hitting the leaves was my favourite sight. I'd lay in bed and read or watch a show with all the blinds open and watch the storm roll through.
