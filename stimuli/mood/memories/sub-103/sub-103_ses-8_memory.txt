The entire summer in DC. It was amazing getting to hang out with my platoon and have that independence I had been seeking. I got to create amazing presentations and travel to site visits and work in the same office as our facility dogs everyday. We would drink coffee and play ches sin the artifact room each morning and play pickleball or go to the gym after work. My apartment was right next to the National arboretum, so my entire backyard was the trees and forest, and when it rained the leaves became so bright and beautiful.
