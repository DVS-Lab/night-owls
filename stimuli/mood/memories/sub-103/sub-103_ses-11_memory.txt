My most recent recital season. I didn't get to spend the year practicing and teaching like I normally do, but there were so many amazing moments. The girls I taught for 5, 6, 7 years had their music go out and they kept dancing, and I was so so proud of them. They were doing affirmations backstage too, like I always used to do at the end of class, and had me come over and do it with them. And I got to give them good luck glitter. And of course, there's always the high of the cheering on stage when you hit a cool move (like flipping someone over you're shoulder).
