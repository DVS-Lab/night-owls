My entire summer in DC was spent at my dream internship. Not only did I work in an incredible place, but after our first week i made an amazing group of friends - my platoon. We would go to museums and Tatte and have game nights and play pickleball and go to happy hour and spontaneously have lunch together outside. It was genuinely the perfect summer.
