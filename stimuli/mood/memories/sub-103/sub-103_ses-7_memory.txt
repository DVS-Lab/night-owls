Last night I was invited back to Kutztown as the alumni speaker for the honours banquet. I wrote this speech weaving together Prometheus and fire and the Sunrise on the Reaping and the life they could expect and the world they are walking into. I caught up with so many friends and mentors, ate amazing food and got to celebrate the graduating seniors. When I arrived, Vogel asked if I would announce an award as well, and when I left I had some new projects to work on teaching honours about research and developing an alumni council.
